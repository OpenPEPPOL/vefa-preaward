= Introduction to PEPPOL eTendering and BIS


This BIS is a result of work within {PEPPOL} eTendering workgroups and published as part of their specifications.

This BIS provides a set of specifications for implementing a business process. The document is concerned with clarifying requirements for ensuring interoperability of pan-European Public eProcurement and provides guidelines for supporting these requirements and how to implement. The following are the basis for this work:

* CEN WS/BII3 Profile 54 Submit Tender
* CEN WS/BII3 Profile 35 Advanced Tender with Pre-award Catalogue
* European commission documentation for ESPD 

*The purpose* of this document is to describe a common format for exchanging messages in a procurement procedure, to facilitate an efficient implementation and increased use of electronic tendering based on this format.
