== Customization ID


The {PEPPOL} Customization ID identifies the specification of content and rules that apply to the transaction. This BIS has required some minor additions and changes to the {CENBII} transaction. Following the {CENBII} methodology any extension must be communicated by adding an extension ID onto the Customization ID. The full syntax is:
----
<transactionId>:(restrictive|extended|partly):<extensionId>[(restrictive|extended|partly):<extensionId>].
----
Which customization identification that should be used, is based on which transaction is sent, and the extension identification for this BIS document (47):
