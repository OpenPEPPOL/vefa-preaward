= Introduction to eSENS eTendering and BIS


This BIS is a result of work within {eSENS} eTendering workgroups and published as part of their specifications.

This BIS provides a set of specifications for implementing a business process. The document is concerned with clarifying requirements for ensuring interoperability of pan-European Public eProcurement and provides guidelines for supporting these requirements and how to implement. The following CEN WS/BII3 profiles are the bases for this work:

* Profile 47 Call for Tenders
* Profile 41 European Single Procurement Document

*The purpose* of this document is to describe a common format for exchanging messages in a procurement procedure, to facilitate an efficient implementation and increased use of electronic call for tender and ESPD based on this format.
