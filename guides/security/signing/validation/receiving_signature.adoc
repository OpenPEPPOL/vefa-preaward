===	Receiving a digital signature when it is not required

Article 22.6.c of the public procurement directive states that when it is deemed that an advanced electronic signature is required, then a qualified signature and an advanced electronic signature supported by qualified certificate from any certification authority on a trusted list shall be accepted.

The directive makes no statement related to acceptance of an advanced signature when it is not required; however, receiving such “unnecessary” signatures is likely to happen. A German EO, used to signing a tender with a qualified signature, is likely to sign a tender submitted to Norway the same way, even though the Norwegian CA has not asked for such a signature.

Two options exist:

. Always validate all signatures.
.	Discard unnecessary signatures and treat the tender as if it were unsigned.
This may be considered as a policy decision. This note suggests the following as good practice:

All digital signatures should be validated regardless of whether they are required or not. Signing when not required shall not give the signing actor any advantage or disadvantage.

Care must be taken concerning handling of signature errors (see next section). Discarding a tender due to a signature error when there was no requirement to sign the tender, may not be good practice.
