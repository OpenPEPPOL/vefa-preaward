===	Digital signature on the CEN BII XML document

A digital signature can be applied to the {CENBII} XML document itself, including the case of a manifest structure (see next subsection). The document can be signed the same way as any other part (attachment) of the business protocol message as described in the previous subsection.

The only special case occurs when the {CENBII} document embeds attachments (see <<Embedded attachments - not recommended,7.4.3>>); there are two alternatives:

*	The digital signature covers the entire XML document including the embedded attachments.
*	A {XAdES} signature <<23>> is used, and since XML digital signatures allow signing of only selected parts of an XML document, attachments can be left out of the data to be signed.
*
If embedded attachments are encrypted, the last alternative should (probably) be used; otherwise the signature cannot be validated after decryption of the attachments.
