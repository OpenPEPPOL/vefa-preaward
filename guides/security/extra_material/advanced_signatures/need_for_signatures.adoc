== The need for a legal electronic signature

The commitment of the sender to the message content may have to be
proven. In the case of a tender, this is quite obvious. In a broad
sense, a tender has to have a legal electronic signature.

An electronic signature may need to be preserved for some time and it is
common practice to apply a signature to unencrypted content. This is
particularly important when an AdES (a digital signature) is used; the
signature must be applied before encryption else the signature cannot be
validated after decryption. Signing unencrypted content also pinpoints
that a signature should be created according to WYSIWYS (what you see is
what you sign), a property that is questionable if the content is
encrypted.

The possible semantics (e.g. the authorizations and commitments implied,
if any) of an electronic signature are not discussed further in this
note.
