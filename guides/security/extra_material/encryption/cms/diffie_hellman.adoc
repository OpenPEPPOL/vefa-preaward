===	Adding support for Diffie-Hellman key agreement

For key agreement (Diffie-Hellman), the shared secret key is derived from a combination of the key pairs of the sender and the receiver. Thus, the OriginatorInfo element must be included.

Elliptic curve cryptography requires support for key agreement, i.e. EC DH (elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman). In this case, *both sender and receiver must have certificates for EC DH public keys.* Key agreement may also be used with RSA and other algorithms. This note suggests that this is left for further study, but support for elliptic curve cryptography may become important.
