==	Future need for encryption from CA to EO

The CEN BII specifications only envisage encryption of tender, request for participation, and possibly other documents sent from the EO to the CA. There may however be a need for encryption also of documents sent in the opposite direction:

*	The call for tender may contain confidential information;
*	In a negotiated procedure, confidential information may be sent from the CA.

The situation is in principle symmetric to the one described in the previous sections of this chapter; the only difference is that the EO or the submission service provider mediates the encryption certificate and other parameters, and the CA or the tendering service provider encrypts accordingly.

There is however no specific {CENBII} document sent from the EO that at present can be used to indicate encryption parameters. This topic must be for further study in the successor of the {CENBII} standardisation group.
