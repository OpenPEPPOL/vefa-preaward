==	Receiving side process – decryption, signature validation, proof

.Requirement 9
****
*The process flow for receiving a business protocol message, using a tender as an example, should be as follows:*

. The CA or the tendering service provider fetches the tender message from the access point.
. A hash value of the {ASIC}[ASiC] container is computed and stored for comparison with a possible future {REM} MD evidence if requested.
.	Based on the transport level delivery confirmation (see steps 11-12 above), the CA’s access point can produce, sign, and send to the CA (or to the tendering service provider) a {REM} MD evidence message proving time of delivery to the access point; this time is deemed to be the time of delivery of the tender. Note that the {REM} MD evidence may be requested at any time, e.g. if a dispute arises later in the procurement process.
.	The {ASIC}[ASiC] manifest signature is validated.
.	If a tender manifest is used, the signature of this manifest may also be validated – note that if objects of the tender are encrypted, only the signature of the tender manifest XML structure can be validated; the hash values referring to the individual parts of the tender cannot be recomputed until decryption is done.
.	A business protocol level tender confirmation is sent, or alternatively an error message if signature validation or other checks fail.
.	At the time of tender opening, all encrypted objects are decrypted. Further validation is done, e.g. of signed content that has been encrypted. If a signed tender manifest is used, the whole signature can now be checked, including the hash values of the referenced, unencrypted parts. The resulting unencrypted tender is stored.
.	In case of errors in decryption, signature validation or other parts of the process, error handling must be initiated.

Note that signature validation includes not only cryptographic checks on signature, certificate and certificate validity, but also checks that signature and certificate are according to signature policy requirements.

An {ASIC}[ASiC] container may be “unpacked” and stored in a file system with signature intact provided that the {ASIC}[ASiC] manifest and the detached signature are also stored. In the case of a tender, this may be of limited value since the {ASIC}[ASiC] manifest may contain hash values of encrypted content, which then has to be stored in encrypted form. Also, the {ASIC}[ASiC] includes the inner {SBDH}[SBDH], which may or may not be stored at the CA side.

Use of a signed tender manifest provides a good option as this manifest refers to the unencrypted tender objects and excludes the {SBDH}[SBDH]; however only a few CEN BII profiles use a manifest structure.
