=== Adding the transport level confirmation to the REM MD evidence

When payload information is added to the transport level confirmation,
this confirmation constitutes a proof that this specific payload was
received at the access point at the time indicated. The transport level
confirmation is the base evidence signed by the receiving access point.

This note specifies that the signed transport level confirmation shall
be included in the {REM} MD evidence (see Figure 16 below) as an extension
as allowed by the {REM} standard <<27>>. The extension should identify the
type of the transport level confirmation, e.g. AS2 MDN or AS4 ebReceipt.
The detailed structure of the extension is not specified by this note;
this specification will be done when/if the necessary changes are
approved by the PEPPOL Management Board.

Thus, the semantics of the {REM} MD evidence, using AS2 as example, is
that:

* The specific, identified payload (the {ASIC}[ASiC] container)
represented by hash value in the AS2 MDN extension was received at the
access point that has signed the AS2 MDN at the time inside the AS2 MDN
extension.

Information elements such as time and message identification could be
copied to the main part of the {REM} MD evidence. As shown, the access
points independently produce and sign the {REM} MD evidence for its local
customer.

The transport level confirmation inside the {REM} MD evidence is signed by
use of a certificate issued by the internal PEPPOL eDelivery PKI. No
business level actor can be assumed to be able to validate this
signature on its own. But since the transport level confirmation should
be on a standard format (e.g. AS2 MDN), business level actors and other
parties may be capable of parsing the structure to read out information.
For signature validation and for parsing if needed, an access point or
another actor within the domain of the PEPPOL PKI for {eDelivery}
should be asked to assist.

Since disputes involving use of the {REM} MD evidence must be expected to
occur shortly after the event, issues regarding expiry or revocation of
any certificate used to sign is considered out of scope. This concerns
the signature of the transport level confirmation and the signature of
the {REM} MD evidence itself. An EO that has its tender refused must take
immediate action. Correspondingly for the CA to prove that the tender
was too late or in time. Thus, a basic signature format should be
sufficient for the {REM} MD evidence signature. The crucial time element
is inside the evidence, not related to any time-stamp applied to the
signatures of the evidence.

Note: {eIDAS} article 44.f requires events related to a qualified
eDelivery service to be attested by qualified time-stamps. This
requirement may be considered in the future.
