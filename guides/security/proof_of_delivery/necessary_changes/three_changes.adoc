== Necessary changes to CEF eDelivery

[[three_changes]]
=== Three necessary changes that do not break existing models

The need for a proof of delivery of the time a message is received at
the receiver's access point is described in <<received_message, section 6.3>>. Both sender and
receiver may need to obtain such a proof. This must by necessity be
implemented by adding functionality to the access points of
{eDelivery}. The solution specified by this note requires minimal changes
and is built on the following goals:

*Â No business level logic in an access point. All access points
treat all messages the same way regardless of sender, receiver, and
content. No inspection of message content is needed.

* No change in the communication patterns of an access point. An
access point only communicates with other access points and only
provides a service interface to its customers (CA/EO).

* No change in {eDelivery} communication protocols. But note
that an additional information element is needed in message
confirmations.

* No change in existing trust model. A business level actor (CA or
EO) has one trusted supplier of communication services: its access
point. A business level actor shall not need to know or trust other
components (other access points) of {eDelivery}.

Only three changes are necessary in protocols and interfaces for the
solution specified; these are described in the following sections:

* Payload identification has to be present in the transport level
message confirmation between the access points. In the case of this
note, this is identification of the {ASIC}[ASiC] container in the form of a hash
value; but the solution specified should work with any payload. Payload
identification is present when AS4 is used but must be added when AS2 is
used.

* The access points must be required to be able to sign and
deliver {REM} MD evidences to their customers (CA/EO) over the offered
service interfaces.

* The transport level confirmation must be included in the REM MD
evidence.

Requirements are also imposed for changes in internal processing in
access points and at other actors but this does not affect protocols and
interfaces.
