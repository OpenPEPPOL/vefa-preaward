=== Adding payload identification to the transport level confirmation

The format of the transport level confirmation sent from the receiving
access point to the sending access point depends on the protocol used,
e.g. it is different for AS2 <<17>>, which is used by PEPPOL eDelivery,
and AS4 <<15>>, which is recommended by {eDelivery} and by e-SENS. In
AS2, a Message Disposition Notification (MDN) <<16>> is used. In AS4, an
eb:Receipt with non-repudiation of receipt is used.

In both these cases, the transport level confirmation acknowledges (by
identification and hash value) the message sent by the other access
point, i.e. including headers and other information added by this access
point. This is useless as part of a proof of delivery to sender and
receiver (the CA or EO). These actors never see the transport level
packaging with headers and can neither identify a transport level
message nor compute or verify its hash.

The solution, shown in Figure 15 for AS2, is compliant with the AS2
specifications:

. At the receiving access point, create an information element
consisting of:

.. the hash of the payload (the ASiC container in the case of this
note),

.. the time of reception.

. Add this element as an extension to the transport level
confirmation, i.e. an extension-field of the AS2 MDN.

The detailed structure of the information element is not included in
this note but will be specified when/if the necessary change request is
approved by the PEPPOL Management Board.

For AS4, the message signature applied by the sending
access point (using WS-Security and XML Signature) specifies the signed
data using a `ds:SignedInfo` element which includes a list of `ds:Reference`
elements,  each of which corresponds to a <part identification, part
hash> pair.  The ASiC container is a separate AS4 message part encoded
as a MIME part. The `ds:Reference` for that MIME part has a part
identifier (a MIME content-id) and a MIME part hash.  This and all other
`ds:Reference` elements can be reused as-is in generating the AS4 receipt
once the receiving access point has validated the message
signature. Thus, for AS4 there is no need for changes except for
specification of the conventions for generating the AS4 receipt.

Since all actors (access points, senders, receivers) are able to compute
the payload (ASiC container) hash, the hash value can be compared across
all of them.

[NOTE]
====
No actor is strictly required to store the payload (the ASiC
container) permanently. The requirement is that its hash value must be
computed and stored in a relationship to the business protocol message
that is transmitted in the ASiC container. The business protocol message
can be assumed to be archived.

Since parts of a payload may be encrypted as specified by this
note, the payload hash is calculated on the encrypted information, which
cannot necessarily be reconstructed.
