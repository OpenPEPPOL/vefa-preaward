=== Signing and delivery of REM MD evidence from an access point

An actor shall receive the {REM} MD evidence from its local access point,
which is its trusted provider of the reliable communication service (see
Figure 16 below). Thus, two requirements are added:

* The service interface (which is not standardized) of an access
point must be extended to deliver {REM} MD evidences, either on demand or
"automated" for all messages.

* The [REM] MD evidence must be signed by the access point, or by
the actor in charge of the access point, in such a way that the customer
of the access point can verify the signature.

Regarding the service interface, its realization is out of scope of this
note but it is observed that the access point can use one of two modes.
Either the {REM} MD evidence is delivered routinely to the customer for
each message acknowledged, or a service is established for the customer
to request a {REM} MD evidence for an identified message (by hash value)
on demand. As the expectation is that a {REM} MD evidence will rarely be
needed, the on demand alternative may be preferred. This provides some
compatibility if messages are relayed across several eDelivery services,
see <<Interconnecting multiple eDelivery infrastructures, section 15.3>>.

Regarding signing, the access point today only has a certificate from
the PEPPOL PKI for its role in communication over {eDelivery}. This
PKI is "closed" and internal to {eDelivery}. One cannot completely
rule the alternative of using this access point certificate to sign a
{REM} MD evidence sent to a business level actor but it is likely that
this will not be applicable.

This means that an access point in order to sign {REM} MD evidences should
obtain another certificate from a "well-known" certification authority.
Alternatively, at a minimum the certification authority can be a "local"
PKI well known between the access point and its customers.

This note does not pose further requirements on {REM} MD evidence signing
but recommendations are:

* The {REM} MD evidence should be signed by an e-seal, i.e. a
signature by a legal person.

* The certificate should identify the legal person in charge of
the access point. Further attributes may identify the access point role
of the legal person.

* Use of a qualified e-seal supported by a certification authority
on the EU trusted list system should be considered.

NOTE: Availability of qualified e-seal certificates will be limited in
the short term since this is a new role introduced at EU level by eIDAS
from 1 ^st^ July 2016.

* The signature format should be as specified in ETSI TS 102Â 640-2
<<27>> section 6.3. Here, XAdES is recommended for an XML Evidence, CAdES
for an ASN.1 Evidence, and PAdES for a PDF Evidence. A basic signature
format without a time-stamp should be sufficient (see next section).

NOTE: The REM specifications may soon be updated by ETSI. In case,
the recommendations for signature formats should be updated to refer to
the latest EN versions of the format standards.
