== Requirements to all actors for REM MD evidence interoperability

In order for a {REM} MD evidence to be produced by access points in a
predetermined way and be useful to the sender and receiver of a business
protocol message as proof of delivery, the access point must fulfill the
requirements stated in the previous sections of this chapter.
Additionally:

.Requirement 46
****
The sender, the receiver, and both access points
shall compute a hash of the payload (the {ASIC}[ASiC] container) and store the
hash value as reference.

NOTE: The business protocol message (e.g. the tender) sent or received
will routinely be stored at both sides; the hash value can be stored as
metadata connected to this.
****

.Requirement 47
****
The hash value shall be calculated by SHA-256 <<33>>
over the binary representation of the {ASIC}[ASiC] container.
****
