== REM MD evidence format for proof of delivery

A proof of delivery should be on a standard format in order to enable
the proof to be presented to and validated by "any" actor. The {REM} MD
evidence format (Registered Electronic Mail, Message Delivery) <<27>> is
possibly the only applicable standard format.

This format is defined for use by {REM} messaging systems. In the case
described by this note, {eDelivery}, which is not based on {REM}, is
used. This means that the {REM} MD evidence format is used but not the
rest of the {REM} specifications.
