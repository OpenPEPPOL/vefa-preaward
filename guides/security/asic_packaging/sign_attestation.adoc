== ASiC signing attesting to sender identity

Possibly in a majority of the situations, the {ASIC}[ASiC] container will be
signed by a service provider and not by the "real" sender. E.g. for
Norway it is likely that advanced electronic signatures will not be
required even on a tender, meaning that the EO does not need to possess
signing certificates. No part of the tender will be signed (except
possibly parts signed by other actors than the EO).

Even if the sender has the ability to digitally sign the {ASIC}[ASiC] container,
the process flow of a service provider may be best implemented in a way
where a service provider signs the {ASIC}[ASiC] container. In this case, parts
of the message may or may not be signed by the sender.

In particular, for the case where no part of the message is signed,
there is no authentication of the sender, only identification by the
inner SBDH and possibly inside the message. The receiver, e.g. a CA
receiving a tender, may need proof that the EO submitting the tender has
been authenticated and that the tender submission is an explicit and
informed action.

The resulting requirement was stated in section <<simple_signing, 9.3>> and is illustrated
by <<fig8,Figure 8>>: _The {ASIC}[ASiC] container signature (the actor digitally signing the container) shall attest to the correctness of the identity of the
sender as identified in the inner SBDH and to the fact that the sender
has explicitly committed to the sending of the business protocol
message._

In the case where the sender signs the {ASIC}[ASiC] itself, this proof is
obvious as shown by <<fig9,Figure 9>> below and as stated in the requirements in sections <<individual,11.2.2>> and <<sign_asic_container,11.2.3>>.

However, the scenarios shown in <<fig10,Figure 10>> below are a priori not
acceptable.

Even if the {ASIC}[ASiC] container signature is fully verifiable, e.g. it is a
qualified electronic seal, there is no link from the signer to the
identity of the sender, meaning (left-hand part of Figure 10) that YYY
may fake a message purporting to be from XXX, or otherwise sign an {ASIC}[ASiC]
container where the real sender is an attacker and not the identified
sender.

The right-hand part of Figure 11 shows that where an individual part of
the message shall be signed by the sender, but is signed by someone
else, this shall not be accepted regardless of the signature on the {ASIC}[ASiC]
container. In fact, this illustrates violation of the requirements of
section <<individual,11.2.2>>.
