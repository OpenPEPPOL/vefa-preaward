== Conditions for service provider signing of ASiC container

As it is still desired that a service provider (another actor than the
sender) shall be allowed to sign the {ASIC}[ASiC], one must find conditions
where the situation in Figure 12 (note similarity to the "unacceptable"
left-hand side of Figure 11) is accepted.

As stated in <<simple_signing, section 9.3>>, the proof of the association should be
interpreted to mean that the {ASIC}[ASiC] seal attests to the following
conditions:

. The sealer has authenticated the sender; usually by
authenticating a human user authorized to act on behalf of the sender.

. The sealer has ensured that sending of the message is explicitly
requested by the sender (by an authorized person).

. Sufficient proof of these actions is available in proper logs.

Not even a qualified electronic seal is by itself sufficient to fulfill
these conditions; an actor will not be required to commit to such
conditions in order to receive a qualified seal certificate from a
certification authority in the market.

The following approaches are possible:

. Use a dedicated PKI where only actors that commit to the
conditions above can obtain certificates.

. Use some form of trusted list (any mechanism from a local file to
a mimic of the EU trusted list system using format as specified by <<28>>)
where actors that commit to the conditions can be listed with their
certificates.

. Accept a (qualified) seal supported by a certificate from a
certification authority on the EU trusted list system, assuming that the
conditions are met even though not guaranteed by the seal.

Alternative 2 can work in the short term with "informal" lists. For
scaling, a formal system is needed, which implies a new infrastructure
to issue the specific trusted list and rather cumbersome adaptation of
trusted list processing in systems; in addition to normal signature
processing.

Alternative 3 can be viewed as an "optimistic approach" assuming all is
OK, but carries legal uncertainty in case of errors.

Alternative 1 seems to be the easiest approach, but note that a
dedicated PKI will probably not issue qualified certificates (partly
because eIDAS does not apply to closed systems).
