=== Identification in inner SBDH

The legal entities that are sender and receiver of the message are
identified in the inner {SBDH}[SBDH]. The {SBDH}[SBDH] provides no authentication; the
identities given are the claimed identities only.

.Requirement 41
****
Identification of sender and receiver in the inner
{SBDH}[SBDH] shall be by a unique number from a business register or a similar
identifier.

NOTE: In Norway identification shall be by organisational number from
Enhetsregisteret (register of business enterprises).
****

Encoding of the number and identification of the register that is the
source for the number are not specified in this note. The ETSI
certificate profile standard <<30>>, part 1, specifies "semantic
identifiers" that can be used to encode identifiers for both natural and
legal persons.
