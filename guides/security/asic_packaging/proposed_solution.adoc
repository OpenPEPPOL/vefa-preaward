== Proposed solution: Dedicated PEPPOL PKI for ASiC sealing

The proposal made by this note is to establish a dedicated PKI for {ASIC}[ASiC]
sealing certificates as a separate sub-certification authority of the
existing PEPPOL PKI. PEPPOL has a well-established scheme for access
point certificates, which is provided upon entering into an agreement
with a PEPPOL authority. This scheme is well understood and has proven
to work across borders. The same scheme can be applied for {ASIC}[ASiC] signing.

A change request has been filed to PEPPOL's Management Board and
eventually should be filed to CEF Digital. The change is highly desired
but not critical in the short term. Alternative 2 above will work as
long as the number of actors is small, and in particular will work for a
Norwegian e-procurement system where the service providers can be
assumed to be few and well-known.

The certificate policy will require an agreement where the subscriber of
the certificate commits to the necessary requirements. Henceforth a
signature supported by the certificate commits that the signer of the
{ASIC}[ASiC] archive has spent reasonable effort to associate the documents
inside the {ASIC}[ASiC] archive with the legal entity, which has issued the
documents. The {ASIC}[ASiC] signer will by the certificate agreement be legally
responsible for this effort, refer <<fig12, Figure 13>>.

It is important to note that the certificates shall apply to the {ASIC}[ASiC]
signing function only. Any service provider, regardless of the service
provided, and in principle any other actor, can obtain a certificate.
The certificate does not imply any commitment regarding other aspects of
the service provided, e.g. obtaining the certificate does not require a
check that a tendering service is run as it should.

This is pinpointed by the figures in <<fig4,section 9.3>>, showing that {ASIC}[ASiC]
signing can be carried out by a service provider, by an access point, or
even (at least in theory, the business case is not clear) by a separate
actor. Each of these may obtain a certificate for the {ASIC}[ASiC] signing
role/function.

For {ASIC}[ASiC] signatures, the resulting scenario is that the situations in
<<fig13, Figure 13>> shall be deemed to be correct. This solves the issue
identified by <<fig11,Figure 11>>.

PEPPOL's liabilities must be clear. By issuing certificates pursuant to
either an appendix to the existing Transport Infrastructure Agreement or
a separate agreement, PEPPOL might be liable to litigation. Referring to
<<fig12,Figure 12>>, if parties A and B enters into an agreement with PEPPOL in
order to obtain certificates for signing {ASIC}[ASiC] archives, who is liable if
one of the parties does not follow the requirements pursuant to the
agreement? What happens if PEPPOL by mistake issues a certificate to a
party without the written agreement?
